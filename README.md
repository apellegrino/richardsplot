Matplotlib plotting standards for Gordon Richards' group

### Setup ###

```
% pip install richardsplot
```

### Usage ###

In your Python script, add

```
import numpy as np
import matplotlib as mpl
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
import palettable
import richardsplot as rplot

```

Your `rcParams` variable will change to meet the standards.


Some matplotlib color cycles are also defined. To use them, do something like one of the following:

```
plt.plot(x,y,color=rplot.csdark[2])
```
or
```
ax.set_color_cycle(rplot.csdark)
```

Where `ax` is the matplotlib axis instance of interest.

###Good Plotting Guidelines###

Please also see the plotting guidelines that Nadia Zakamska has put together for her group at JHU:
http://zakamska.johnshopkins.edu/COMPUTING/graph_guide.html

I'll emphasize the need for text in plots to be as big or bigger than the text in the paper (which this package should help solve), the need to make good color choices, and separation of analysis and plot making (so that remaking a plot doesn't mean re-running your analysis code).

###Test Plots###

If you want to suggest changes to the default parameters, first edit your own version and remake the test plots (currently just testplot1.py):
```
> python testplot1.py
```
then compare your new figure to testplot1.pdf and let me know why you think that your new version is better.

Please contribute additional test plots.
